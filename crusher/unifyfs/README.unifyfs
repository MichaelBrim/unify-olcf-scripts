The source for UnifyFS was cloned from the public repo at
https://github.com/LLNL/UnifyFS. We used the version of the code obtained by
`git checkout v1.0d` which uses the 'v1.0d' tag.

The build commands used for UnifyFS are found in the 'unifyfs-build-crusher.sh'
file. The build assumes the appropriate system modules have been loaded by 
sourcing the 'crusher/load-modules-gcc11-crusher.sh' file, and the Spack 
environment for the UnifyFS dependencies (see the 'crusher/spack-env' directory)
has been previously installed.
